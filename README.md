I am currently learning HTML and CSS to build modern, responsive, and user-friendly front-end websites. I am focusing on understanding web structure, styling, layouts, and design principles to create clean and visually appealing interfaces. Through consistent practice and small projects, I aim to strengthen my foundation in front-end development and improve my overall web development skills.
